# bean
A multi cryptocurrency exchange interface that supports
* retrieval of historical transaction data and limit order book
* retrieval of real time limit order book
and (to be done)
* backtest and simulation of trading strategies
* real trading strategies

Bean is a lightweight wrapper of a bunch of remote protocal calls (RPC). 

# To start with

* Get real time order book:
```
package main

import (
	. "bean"
	"bean/rpc"
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	ex := bean.NewRPCExchangeC("tcp", "13.229.125.250:9892") // create an RPC exchange client
	pair := Pair{BTC, USDT} // pair to query for the orderbook
	ob, _ := ex.GetOrderBook(pair) // making the query
	fmt.Println(ob) // print it out
}
```

To run it:

``` 
go run example/orderbook/main.go 
```

* Retrieve historical orderbook and transactions:
``` go run example/mds/main.go ```
